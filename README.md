<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project requires us to build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns. The game is to operate based on the same set of rules of the real life tic-tac-to game.

## Rules Of The Game

The game is really fun to play but consist of a set of simple rules to get started. The rules of the game are as highlighted in the steps below. Just follow rules step by step and you will see yourself become a master of the game in no time. 

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. It basicly involves each player placing his/her mark in empty squares in turn.

NOTE : Two players can't place their marks in the same square. Once a square is occupied, then the next player has to choose from any of the empty squares left.

2. Your mark is represented by X and your friend's mark is represented by O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. 

3. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are filled without any of the players having their marks in a row, then the game is over and ended in a tie.


## How To Start The Game

You don't need to be a programmer to start the game. There are simple instructions in form of prompt messages throughout the game to tell you the next thing to do at any point in time.
<br>
You only need to launch your command prompt and navigate the project folder and type "bin/main.rb". Then you will start seeing different prompt messages to guide you on what to do next.
